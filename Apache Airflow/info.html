    <h2>Airflow local installation steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a local python environment inside the project directory -</li>
             >> python -m venv py_env [py_env -> name fo the python environment] 

            <li>source the virtual environment - </li>
             >> source py_env/bin/activate 
             or
             >> . py_env/in/activate [if the "source" command is not accessible]

            <li>Install Apache Airflow locally - </li>
             >> pip install apache-airflow 
             or
             >> conda install apche-airflow [for anaconda based python environment]
            
             <li>Set the current directory as the airflow home - </li>
             >> cd <dir_path where airflow is installed>
             >> export AIRFLOW_HOME=~/airflow [use absolute path, avoid using any relative path]
            
            <li>Initialize the airflow database</li>
             >> airflow db init
               
            <li>Create new user for airflow</li>
                Airflow does not use any default username and password when we are using a python wheel
                We need to use the following command to create a new user [admin]

             For Airflow>=2.0.0

             >> airflow users create --role Admin --username admin --email admin --firstname admin --lastname admin --password admin

            <li>Start the airflow webserver</li>
             >> airflow webserver -p 8080 [The default port for airflow server is 8080] <br>
        
             If airflow fails to start @ the default port, change the port in "airflow.cfg" file <br>
             present in the same folder, then use the following command to start the server in the new port

             >> airflow webserver -p <newportNumber>

            Airflow will start in the following terminal -> localhost:808

        </ol>

        Everytime we want to start Airflow/run Airflow commands, we must perform the following 2 tasks --emailul
        
    </p>

    <p>
        As suggested, we should use  SQLite as metadata DB for dev/testing purposes only <br><br>

        We must use Postgres/MySQL for the production server. <br>
        Also we must not use SequentialExecutor in production. <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Dashboard Issue : The scheduler does not appear to be running</h2>
    <p>
        This is a common error in Airflow for which we need to restart the scheduler in a new shell. <br>
        Followed by refreshing the dashboard. <br>
        Steps :- 
                <ol>
                    <li>Open a new terminal</li>
                    <li>Export the airflow environment</li>
                        >> export AIRFLOW_HOME=~/airflow [As we have set earlier]
                    <li>source the local python environment</li>
                        >> source py_env/bin/activate [As configured previously]
                    <li>Run the Airflow Scheduler</li>
                        >> airflow scheduler  [command to start the airflow scheduler]
                </ol> 
        After these steps just refresh the dashboard and the message will be gone. <br>
        And we will be able to schedule tasks.
